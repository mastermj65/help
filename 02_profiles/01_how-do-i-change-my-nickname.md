# How do I change my nickname?

You can change your own nickname once every 28 days. Here's a quick link: https://fetlife.com/settings/account/nickname.

To update your nickname:

1. Click on the hamburger menu (icon with three horizontal lines) on the far right of FetLife's navigation bar.
2. Click on “Update Settings" in the pop out menu.
3. Click "Change" next to your nickname under the Account tab.

You should also check to see if anyone on the site is already using the nickname you want. A quick way to do this is to type in http://fetlife.com/usernameYOUwant in the URL bar. If you are taken to your activity feed, the name is available. :-)
