# How do I make a secondary profile?

Simple! You make it the same way you made your first profile. If you're already logged in to a profile, you'll need to follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the hamburger menu (icon with three horizontal lines) on the far right of FetLife's navigation bar.
2. Click on "Logout" in the pop out menu
3. Click "Join FetLife"

Please note that FetLife requires a unique:

- email address
- nickname
- phone number (if using SMS verification) or email invitation from a past or current FetLife Supporter
