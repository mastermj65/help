# Supported Browsers

To optimally browse FetLife we highly recommend using our supported browsers:

#### Desktop browsers

* Chrome 79+
* Safari 9+
* Edge 79+
* Firefox 68+
* Internet Explorer 11+
* Android Browser 4.4+

#### What if my current browser is not on the list above?

If you are on a slightly older browser (or on a modern alternative browser), chances are everything will work just fine. In case you experience issues over time or are perving through an old browser, we recommend you upgrade it or change it. We recommend installing these browsers:

- On Windows: Upgrade to [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome)
- On Apple Products: Upgrade Safari or move to [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome)

If you are already on a supported browser but you are still encountering issues, we recommend upgrading your browser.

#### How do I upgrade my browser?

Each browser does upgrading differently:

* [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)
* [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416)
* [Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-sysupdate-windows-updates)
* [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-release)
* Internet Explorer: We recommend updating to any of the browsers above.
* Android Browser: We recommend updating to [Google Chrome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&hl=en)

#### What about my bookmarks, history, etc.?

You will be given an option to import existing data from your old browser during install.

#### Why all this?

FetLife's engineering team follows development best practices but outdated browsers can't keep up with them. By upgrading your browser you'll not only help us pushing the product forward faster, but also experience a safer and faster browsing experience across the web.
